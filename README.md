# Primality test
This repo contains the montecarlo primality test implemented in C with it's own integer library

## Usage

The usage of the program works with a console menu that allows the user to enter a number or to enter an input file and an output file.
If an input file is given, it must be in the form:

```num1,num2,num3....```

and the output file is in the form:

```COMPUESTO,PRIMO,PRIMO...```

where COMPUESTO means composed number and PRIMO means prime number.
